    "# Generation tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows you how to generate slabs of different thicknesses, terminations and Miller indices systematically. It is commonly required to run a series of calculations on a set of slabs for one material to answer the questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "- How thick should my slab be to ensure it is bulk-like in the centre? \n",
    "- How much vacuum do I need to ensure one side of the slab does not interact with the other? (this is particularly useful for codes like VASP which enforce 3D periodic boundary conditions)\n",
    "- Which Miller index and termination combinations have zero net dipole?\n",
    "- Which Miller index and termination combinations have the lowest surface energy? \n",
    "\n",
    "The `surfaxe.generation` module allows for easy generation of zero-dipole, symmetric slabs for convergence testing purposes either up to a maximum Miller index or for a specific Miller index. \n",
    "\n",
    "By passing the structure, required Miller index, and lists of slab and vacuum thicknesses, `generate_slabs` can generate unique zero-dipole symmetric surface slabs for all combinations of slab and vacuum thickness. As ever, [pymatgen](https://pymatgen.org) does most of the heavy lifting, but we have extra options to:\n",
    " \n",
    "- Detect duplicated slabs\n",
    "- Automatically save structures in a sensible file format with some additional structure site properties\n",
    "- Additionally save other DFT calculation input files so each slab is ready to run\n",
    "- Output the directory structure in such a way that once the DFT calculations are run, `surfaxe.convergence` can easily extract the key data and plot it"
