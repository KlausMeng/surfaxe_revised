    "`slabby stabby` `generation` module allows for easy generation of zero-dipole symmetric slabs for convergence testing purposes either up to a maximum Miller index or for a specific Miller index. By passing the structure, required Miller index variable, and lists of slab and vacuum thicknesses, `get_all_slabs` and `get_one_hkl_slabs` can generate unique zero-dipole symmetric surface slabs for all combinations of slab and vacuum thickness. \n",
