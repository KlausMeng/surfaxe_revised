Tutorials
=========

We recommend starting off by looking at the `dedicated tutorials. <https://github.com/SMTG-UCL/surfaxe/tree/master/tutorials>`_ 
These Jupyter notebooks will guide you through most of the functionality of the package. 

The tutorials can also be run interactively `on Binder. <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SMTG-UCL/surfaxe/HEAD?filepath=tutorials`_
